# Selenium Web Scraping 

## Introduction

This project demonstrates web scraping using Selenium to automate browser interactions and extract data from web pages. Selenium is a powerful tool that allows for more complex interactions with web pages compared to other web scraping libraries.It can handle tasks such as clicking CAPTCHAs and behaving like a human bot to avoid detection.

### Other Web Scraping Project

Additionally, you can check out another web scraping project that uses BeautifulSoup for extracting data from web pages.([here](https://github.com/merveozan/CENG463_Fall23_Machine-Learning_Projects/tree/main/CENG463_HW1) )
